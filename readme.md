# Gutenberg Detector

Gutenberg Detector is a simple WordPress plugin that adds a new column in the WordPress admin post/page table which indicates if the post is using Gutenberg editor.

## Description

With the introduction of the Gutenberg editor in WordPress 5.0, creating content has become more flexible and intuitive. However, if you've been using WordPress for a while, you might have content created with both the Classic editor and Gutenberg. The Gutenberg Detector helps you quickly identify which posts or pages are using the Gutenberg editor.

The Gutenberg Detector uses WordPress's built-in `has_blocks` function to check if a post or page contains Gutenberg blocks. If it does, the plugin will display "Yes" in the new "Gutenberg Editor" column for that post or page. If not, it will display "No".

## Installation

1. Download the Gutenberg Detector plugin from this repository.
2. Navigate to the Plugins page in your WordPress admin area.
3. Click "Add New" and then "Upload Plugin".
4. Choose the Gutenberg Detector plugin file you just downloaded and click "Install Now".
5. Once the plugin is installed, click "Activate".

## Usage

Once the plugin is activated, you will see a new column labeled "Gutenberg Editor" in your posts and pages tables in the WordPress admin area. This column will display "Yes" if the post or page was created with the Gutenberg editor and "No" otherwise.
